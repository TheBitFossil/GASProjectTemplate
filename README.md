# GAS Template Project
*Taking the GameplayAbilitySystem and GASDocumentation to learn and create my own version.*\
\
*I made this guide for everyone who is interested in starting with the GAS. I focused on making this  
easy to read and learn from mainly for beginners of the GAS. When you are ready and have a working template 
I highly recommend taking the next step and reading the other sources which are available online.*

*Next to the source code you will find a template project, indepth explanation, step by step instructions 
and visualization of the responsible components*
