# GAS Template Project
I have embarked on a journey to learn and develop my own version of the **Gameplay Ability System (GAS), utilizing the GAS Documentation as a valuable resource**. With the aim of making it accessible to beginners, I have created a comprehensive guide that is easy to read and learn from. Once you have grasped the fundamentals and have a functional template, I strongly encourage you to explore additional online resources for further knowledge.

Within the guide, you will find not only the source code but also a **template project, detailed explanations, step-by-step instructions, and visual representations** of the various components involved. It is my intention to provide a comprehensive learning experience for individuals interested in starting their journey with the GAS.

# Guide
* How to initialize GAS ?
* What is the GAS ?
* How to start with the GAS ?
* How to make a simple Ability ?

# Detailed Step by Step instruction
* Where to start reading and writing code to make a template
* Short explanation of the Components

# Engine/ Languages
Unreal Engine 5.2, C++, Blueprints
